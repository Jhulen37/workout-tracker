          Workout and Fitness Tips for Beginners
        </h1>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">
          Getting started with a fitness routine can be daunting, but it doesn't
          have to be. Here are some tips to help you get on the right track:
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6">1. Start Slow</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
          Don't try to do too much too soon. Start with short workouts and
          gradually increase the length and intensity over time.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6">
          2. Set Realistic Goals
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
          Set achievable goals that are specific, measurable, and realistic.
          This will help you stay motivated and track your progress.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6">
          3. Mix Up Your Workouts
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
          Don't get stuck in a rut doing the same workout every day. Mix it up
          by trying new exercises, classes, or activities.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6">
          4. Fuel Your Body
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
          Eating a healthy, balanced diet is essential for a successful fitness
          journey. Make sure to fuel your body with nutrient-rich foods.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6">
          5. Rest and Recover
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
          Rest and recovery are just as important as exercise. Make sure to get
          enough sleep and take rest days to allow your body to recover.
